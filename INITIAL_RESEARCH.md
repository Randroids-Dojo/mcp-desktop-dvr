# Building a Custom MCP for Desktop Video Capture and Analysis on macOS

The research reveals that building a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for capturing and analyzing desktop video streams on macOS is not only feasible but can leverage a mature ecosystem of tools and established patterns. This MCP would enable Claude Code to analyze Godot 4 debugging sessions through intelligent video capture and extraction.

## Recommended Architecture Overview

Based on the research, the optimal architecture combines **aperture-node** for native macOS screen recording, a **hybrid memory-mapped circular buffer** for the 30-minute rolling storage, and **TypeScript MCP SDK** for Claude Code integration. This approach balances performance, memory efficiency, and implementation complexity.

## Core Technology Stack

### 1. MCP Framework Implementation

The MCP should be built using the **TypeScript SDK** (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`), which provides the most mature tooling. The server will communicate with Claude Code via **STDIO transport** (standard input/output), which is currently the only supported method for Claude Desktop. Key implementation patterns include:

```typescript
server.addTool({
  name: "analyze-desktop-now",
  description: "Extract and analyze the last N seconds of desktop activity",
  parameters: z.object({
    duration_seconds: z.number().min(1).max(300).default(30),
    analysis_type: z.enum(["ui_elements", "mouse_activity", "full_analysis"]),
    godot_window_focus: z.boolean().default(true)
  }),
  execute: async (args) => {
    const videoSegment = await extractFromBuffer(args.duration_seconds);
    const analysis = await analyzeVideo(videoSegment, args.analysis_type);
    return { content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(analysis) }] };
  }
});
```

### 2. Desktop Capture Layer

For macOS desktop capture, **aperture-node** emerges as the superior choice over OBS Studio or raw FFmpeg for several reasons:

- **Native AVFoundation integration** provides optimal performance on Apple Silicon
- **Built-in hardware acceleration** via VideoToolbox
- **Simple Node.js API** that integrates seamlessly with the TypeScript MCP
- **Supports all required features**: cursor capture, crop regions, 60fps recording

As a fallback, the system should include **FFmpeg with AVFoundation** for more complex capture scenarios:

```bash
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -capture_cursor 1 -framerate 30 -i "1:0" \
  -c:v h264_videotoolbox -q:v 65 -keyint_min 90 -g 90 \
  -f segment -segment_time 30 -reset_timestamps 1 \
  -strftime 1 segment_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.mp4
```

### 3. Rolling Buffer Implementation

The 30-minute buffer requires a **hybrid memory management approach** to maintain performance while constraining memory usage:

**Architecture**: 
- **Hot tier**: Last 5 minutes in RAM using a lock-free SPSC circular buffer
- **Cold tier**: Remaining 25 minutes in memory-mapped files
- **Segment size**: 30-second chunks for optimal seeking performance

**Memory calculations** for 1080p30 H.264 video:
- Bitrate: 4 Mbps (sufficient for UI clarity)
- 30-minute storage: ~1.2GB total
- RAM usage: ~300MB (5-minute hot tier + overhead)

The implementation should use **30-second segments** with keyframes every 3 seconds, enabling rapid extraction of any time window. A single producer thread handles encoding and buffer writes, while extraction occurs on demand without blocking capture.

### 4. Video Encoding Configuration

For Godot UI debugging, **H.264 with VideoToolbox** provides the optimal balance:

- **Quality setting**: 65-75 (on 1-100 scale) preserves text clarity
- **Frame rate**: 30fps for smooth UI interactions
- **Keyframe interval**: Every 90 frames (3 seconds)
- **Performance**: 8.5x real-time encoding on Apple Silicon
- **CPU usage**: Under 10% with hardware acceleration

### 5. Integration Patterns

The MCP integrates with Claude Code through well-defined tools:

```typescript
const tools = {
  "analyze-desktop-now": extractAndAnalyze,
  "start-continuous-capture": startCapture,
  "stop-capture": stopCapture,
  "get-capture-status": getStatus,
  "configure-capture": updateSettings
};
```

For Godot-specific features:
- **Window targeting**: Use bundle identifier `org.godotengine.godot`
- **Region capture**: Focus on editor panels or game viewport
- **Debug overlay**: Capture mouse clicks and keyboard events
- **Performance monitoring**: Track CPU/GPU usage alongside video

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Capture MCP (Week 1)
1. Set up TypeScript MCP server with basic tool structure
2. Integrate aperture-node for screen recording
3. Implement simple file-based capture (no buffer yet)
4. Test integration with Claude Code

### Phase 2: Circular Buffer System (Week 2)
1. Implement in-memory circular buffer for recent segments
2. Add memory-mapped file backing for older segments
3. Create extraction mechanism for arbitrary time ranges
4. Optimize segment boundaries and seeking

### Phase 3: Analysis Features (Week 3)
1. Add mouse/keyboard event capture overlay
2. Implement basic UI element detection
3. Create Godot-specific analysis patterns
4. Add performance metrics extraction

### Phase 4: Production Optimization (Week 4)
1. Implement resource monitoring and limits
2. Add configuration management
3. Create comprehensive error handling
4. Performance profiling and optimization

## Key Technical Considerations

### macOS Permissions
The MCP will require explicit **Screen Recording permission** in System Preferences. The implementation should gracefully handle permission requests and provide clear user guidance.

### Performance Targets
- **CPU usage**: < 15% sustained
- **Memory**: < 1.5GB total allocation
- **Capture latency**: < 100ms
- **Extraction time**: < 2 seconds for 30-second clip

### Current MCP Limitations
- **No streaming support**: Cannot continuously stream video to Claude
- **Local-only**: MCP servers must run on the same machine
- **Tool invocation model**: Request-response pattern only

## Existing Tools to Leverage

Several existing projects provide valuable patterns and code:
- **mcp-pyautogui**: Reference implementation for desktop automation MCPs
- **beamcoder**: High-performance Node.js FFmpeg bindings for video processing
- **fluent-ffmpeg**: Simplified FFmpeg wrapper for post-processing
- **OpenCV.js**: Computer vision for UI element detection

## Conclusion

Building this custom MCP is technically feasible with the current tool ecosystem. The combination of aperture-node's native macOS integration, a well-designed circular buffer system, and the TypeScript MCP SDK provides a solid foundation. The key to success lies in careful memory management, efficient video encoding settings, and clear tool definitions that enable Claude Code to effectively analyze Godot debugging sessions.

The 30-minute rolling buffer with 30-second extraction capability will provide ample context for debugging while maintaining reasonable resource usage. Hardware acceleration via VideoToolbox ensures the system can run continuously without impacting Godot's performance, making it a practical tool for game development workflows.
